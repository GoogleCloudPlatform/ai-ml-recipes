    "title": "Wine Quality Classification",
    "description": "This notebook shows how to classify wine quality based on wine attributes. Imagine you are a wine specialist who is looking for an automated way to categorize the wines you find based on wine quality data from physicochemical tests. You could use a machine learning algorithm to train a model that would be able to predict the quality of a wine based on its physicochemical properties. This would allow you to quickly and easily categorize new wines that you find, without having to manually taste them.",
