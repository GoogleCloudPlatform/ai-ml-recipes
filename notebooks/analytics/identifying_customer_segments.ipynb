        "**The Business Challenge:** Marketing teams often need to optimize budget allocation to maximize return on investment (ROI). A one-size-fits-all marketing strategy is inefficient, leading to wasted ad spend and low engagement, as the messaging is not relevant to all recipients. The business problem is to develop a systematic, data-driven method for partitioning a customer base into distinct groups based on their behavior, enabling more effective and personalized marketing campaigns.\n",
        "\n",
        "While basic segmentation using simple demographic data is straightforward, it often fails to capture the more nuanced differences in customer purchasing patterns. The analytical challenge is to move beyond these simple heuristics and identify meaningful segments based on complex behavioral data, such as purchase frequency, monetary value, and product category preferences. The goal is to produce segments that are not only statistically distinct but also interpretable and actionable for the marketing team.\n",

We will use a generative AI function to analyze the behavioral data of customers within each cluster and programmatically generate qualitative descriptions, including concise segment name, segment summary and tailored marketing suggestions for each segment."
