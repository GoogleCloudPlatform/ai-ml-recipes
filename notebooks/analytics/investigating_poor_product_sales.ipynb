This suggests that whether a shopper has viewed negative reviews related to AI Assistant features is highly influential. Other impactful factors, though to a much lesser degree, include `urbanicity_rural` (0.079), `age_range_46_60` (0.046), and `device_type_mobile` (0.044).

        "*   The model's inability to predict any positive conversions (Precision, Recall, F1-Score of 0.0000) strongly suggests a class imbalance issue.
