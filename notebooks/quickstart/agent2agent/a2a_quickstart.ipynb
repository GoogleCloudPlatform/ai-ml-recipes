    "    *   You have access to sub_agents with specific capabilities (e.g., what kind of requests each agent is designed to handle and what data they output).\n",

    "3.  **Task Planning & Sequencing (for Multi-Step Requests):**\n",
    "    *   Before delegating, outline the sequence of agent tasks.\n",
    "    *   Identify dependencies: Does Agent B need information from Agent A's completed task?\n",
    "    *   Plan to execute tasks sequentially if there are dependencies, waiting for the completion of a prerequisite task before initiating the next one.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Task Delegation & Management:**\n",
    "    *   **For New Single Requests or the First Step in a Sequence:**:\n",
    "        *   The `message` extracted from the user's input, formatted in a way the target agent will understand (check the agent info to better structure the message). \n",
    "    *   **For Subsequent Steps in a Sequence:**\n",
    "        *   Once the prerequisite task is done, gather any necessary output from it.\n",
    "        *   Then, use the next agent in the sequence, providing it with the user's original relevant intent and any necessary data obtained from the previous agent's task.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Communication with User:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Clearly inform the user which agent is handling each task. The user should know the entire sequence of agents you used and the results of each one.\n",
    "*   If the user's request is ambiguous, if necessary information is missing for any agent in the sequence, or if you are unsure about the plan, proactively ask the user for clarification.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Why Use Google A2A (Agent-to-Agent) Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol is a standardized communication framework that enables AI agents to discover, communicate, and collaborate with each other using a common JSON-RPC based protocol.  \n",
    "It provides a uniform way for agents to interact, regardless of their underlying implementation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Standardized Communication Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "- A2A provides a consistent, JSON-RPC based protocol that any agent can implement\n",
    "- Agents can communicate without needing to know each other's internal implementation details\n",
    "- The protocol supports streaming responses for real-time interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Agent Discovery and Metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "- Agents expose their capabilities through standardized metadata (AgentCard)\n",
    "- Each agent publishes its skills, input/output modes, and capabilities\n",
    "- Host agents can dynamically discover what other agents can do through the `.well-known/agent.json` endpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Orchestration and Composition\n",
    "\n",
    "- Enables building complex multi-agent systems where a host agent can orchestrate multiple specialized agents\n",
    "- Supports sequential and parallel task execution patterns\n",
    "- Allows for sophisticated agent collaboration workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Platform Independence\n",
    "\n",
    "- A2A servers can wrap agents from different frameworks (not just ADK)\n",
    "- Agents can be deployed as independent services on different infrastructure\n",
    "- Promotes loose coupling between agents\n",
    "\n",
    "### Differences: Using ADK Agents Directly vs. Through A2A\n",
