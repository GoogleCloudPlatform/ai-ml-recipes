    "This notebook demonstrates a powerful, scalable solution for automating the analysis of legal contracts using Google BigQuery and Vertex AI's Gemini models. It showcases how to transform thousands of unstructured text documents stored in Google Cloud Storage into a structured, queryable, and insightful dataset directly within BigQuery. The process involves using SQL functions to extract key information, assess risk, generate summaries, and finally, visualize the results to enable data-driven decision-making for legal and compliance teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Business Challenge**: For legal, procurement, and finance departments in large organizations, the sheer volume of legal contracts represents a significant operational bottleneck and a hidden source of risk. Manually reviewing thousands of vendor agreements, sales contracts, and partnership deals to identify risks, track obligations, and ensure compliance is an expensive, slow, and notoriously error-prone process. A single missed renewal date can lead to unwanted service continuation, and an overlooked non-standard liability clause can expose the company to millions of dollars in unexpected risk.\n",
    "The problem is one of scale and accessibility. Critical information is locked away in unstructured PDF and Word documents, making it impossible to perform portfolio-wide analysis. Legal teams cannot easily answer fundamental questions like, \"How many of our contracts have a termination for convenience clause?\" or \"Which agreements are governed by a specific jurisdiction?\" without a time-consuming manual review. This reactive approach prevents the business from proactively managing its contractual risks and obligations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Data Science Approach**: This use case transforms a qualitative, manual task into a quantitative, automated one by leveraging Gemini models directly within BigQuery. By treating unstructured text documents in Cloud Storage as if they were structured data, we can use the power and familiarity of SQL to perform large-scale analysis.\n",
    "The workflow begins by creating a remote model in BigQuery that points to a Gemini endpoint in Vertex AI. We then use the AI.GENERATE_TABLE function, providing it with a target schema and a natural language prompt. This prompt instructs the model on exactly what information to extract from each contract, such as \"Identify the governing law,\" \"Extract the contract's effective date and termination date,\" and \"Summarize the limitation of liability clause.\"\n",
    "The model processes each document and populates a new, structured BigQuery table based on the defined schema. This effectively turns a repository of thousands of legal documents into a queryable database. Data scientists and analysts can then use standard SQL to instantly find patterns, identify anomalies, and aggregate risk exposure across the entire contract portfolio. This enables them to build dashboards that monitor key clauses, set up alerts for upcoming renewal dates, and provide leadership with a comprehensive, data-driven view of the company's contractual landscape.\n"

    "2. **Accessing Contract Data in BigQuery**: Creates a BigQuery external table that directly reads raw contract text files from a public Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket. This makes the unstructured data accessible via SQL without needing a separate data loading step.\n",
    "3. **Enabling Generative AI in BigQuery**: Establishes a connection between BigQuery and Vertex AI and then creates a remote model that points to the Gemini 2.5 Flash model. This allows you to invoke the generative AI model using SQL functions.\n",
    "4. **Transforming Text into Structured Data (AI.GENERATE_TABLE)**: Executes a single, powerful SQL query that feeds the raw text of each contract to the Gemini model. A detailed prompt instructs the model to parse the document and return structured information, which is used to automatically create a new, structured BigQuery table.\n",
    "5. **Enriching Data with AI Summaries (AI.GENERATE)**: Builds upon the newly structured data by generating a concise executive summary for each contract. This step combines the extracted fields and the original text to create a high-quality, context-aware summary.\n",
    "6. **Analyzing and Visualizing Insights**: With the contract data now fully structured and enriched, standard SQL queries are used to perform analysis. The results are then visualized using Plotly to create an interactive dashboard that answers key business questions, such as:\n",
    "  * What is the distribution of different contract types?\n",
    "  * Which contracts have the highest risk scores?\n",
    "  * What is the average risk score per contract category?\n",
    "  * How many contracts fall under specific legal jurisdictions?\n",
    "  * Which contracts are expiring soon?"
