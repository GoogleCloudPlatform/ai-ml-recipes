    "### **Automated Legal Contract Analysis with BigQuery & Gemini**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a scalable solution for automating the analysis of legal contracts using **Google BigQuery** and **Vertex AI’s Gemini models**. It showcases how to transform thousands of unstructured documents in Google Cloud Storage into a structured, queryable dataset directly within BigQuery.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. The Business Challenge**\n",
    "For legal, procurement, and finance teams, managing contract volume is a major bottleneck and a hidden source of risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The Problem:** Manually reviewing thousands of agreements is expensive, slow, and error-prone.\n",
    "* **The Risk:** Missed renewal dates or overlooked non-standard liability clauses can expose the company to significant financial loss.\n",
    "* **The Data Block:** Critical information is locked in unstructured PDFs and Word docs. Teams cannot easily answer questions like *\"How many contracts have a termination for convenience clause?\"* without manual intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. The Data Science Approach**\n",
    "We transform this qualitative task into a quantitative workflow by treating unstructured text as structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Connect:** We create a **Remote Model** in BigQuery that points to a Gemini endpoint in Vertex AI.\n",
    "* **Extract:** Using the `AI.GENERATE_TABLE` function, we prompt the model to extract specific fields (e.g., \"Identify governing law,\" \"Extract effective date,\" \"Summarize liability clauses\") based on a target schema.\n",
    "* **Structure:** The model processes the documents and populates a new BigQuery table, turning a document repository into a queryable database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. The Outcome**\n",
    "Data scientists and analysts can now use standard SQL to:\n",
    "* Instantly find patterns and identify anomalies.\n",
    "* Aggregate risk exposure across the entire portfolio.\n",
    "* Build dashboards to monitor renewal dates and contractual landscapes for leadership."

    "1. **Prerequisites and Setup**: Installs the necessary Python libraries and configures Google Cloud settings, including Project ID and region.\n",
    "2. **Accessing Contract Data in BigQuery**: Creates a BigQuery external table that directly reads raw contract text files from a public Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket. This makes the unstructured data accessible via SQL without needing a separate data loading step.\n",
    "3. **Enabling Generative AI in BigQuery**: Establishes a connection between BigQuery and Vertex AI and then creates a remote model that points to the Gemini 2.5 Flash model. This allows you to invoke the generative AI model using SQL functions.\n",
    "4. **Transforming Text into Structured Data (AI.GENERATE_TABLE)**: Executes a single, powerful SQL query that feeds the raw text of each contract to the Gemini model. A detailed prompt instructs the model to parse the document and return structured information, which is used to automatically create a new, structured BigQuery table.\n",
    "5. **Enriching Data with AI Summaries (AI.GENERATE)**: Builds upon the newly structured data by generating a concise executive summary for each contract. This step combines the extracted fields and the original text to create a high-quality, context-aware summary.\n",
    "6. **Analyzing and Visualizing Insights**: With the contract data now fully structured and enriched, standard SQL queries are used to perform analysis. The results are then visualized using Plotly to create an interactive dashboard that answers key business questions, such as:\n",
    "  * What is the distribution of different contract types?\n",
    "  * Which contracts have the highest risk scores?\n",
    "  * What is the average risk score per contract category?\n",
    "  * How many contracts fall under specific legal jurisdictions?\n",
    "  * Which contracts are expiring soon?"
