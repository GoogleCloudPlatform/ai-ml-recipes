    "The **Consumer Price Index (CPI)** is a measure of the average change in prices paid by consumers for a basket of goods and services. **Inflation** is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising and, consequently, the purchasing power of currency is falling.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **CPI** is a key measure of inflation because it tracks the prices of a wide range of goods and services that are purchased by consumers. If the CPI increases, it means that the prices of goods and services have increased on average. This is a sign of inflation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the **CPI increases by 2% in a year**, it means that the **average price of goods and services has increased by 2% over that year**. This means that consumers will need to spend 2% more money to buy the same basket of goods and services that they bought the previous year.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CPI is used by a variety of economic actors, including governments, businesses, and consumers. Governments use the CPI to set economic policy, such as interest rates. Businesses use the CPI to make pricing decisions. Consumers use the CPI to track the cost of living."

    "This code uses the **Monte Carlo** method to simulate the future path of the **Consumer Price Index (CPI)**. The code begins by calculating the historical mean and standard deviation of the percentage change in the CPI. These values are then used to generate a large number of **simulated paths for the future CPI**. Each simulated path is generated by starting with the **current value of the CPI and then adding a series of normally distributed random increments**. The size of the random increments is determined by the historical **mean and standard deviation of the percentage change in the CPI**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the simulated paths have been generated, they are used to calculate the **probability of various future events**. For example, the code can be used to calculate the **probability that the inflation rate in a given year will be below a certain target**. The **Monte Carlo** method is a **powerful tool for forecasting** future economic conditions. By simulating a large number of possible future paths, the Monte Carlo method can provide a more accurate picture of the range of possible outcomes than traditional forecasting methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concepts and theory related to the Monte Carlo method are based on the theory of **probability and statistics**. The Monte Carlo method works by **randomly sampling from a probability distribution**. In the case of the CPI, the probability distribution is the distribution of the percentage change in the CPI. By randomly sampling from this distribution, the Monte Carlo method can generate a large number of possible future paths for the CPI.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Monte Carlo method is a versatile tool that can be used to forecast a wide range of economic variables. In addition to forecasting the CPI, the Monte Carlo method can be used to forecast interest rates, exchange rates, and stock prices. The Monte Carlo method is a valuable tool for anyone who is interested in forecasting future economic conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This code utilizes the **Monte Carlo** simulation technique to model the future path of the **Consumer Price Index (CPI)** and estimate the probability of inflation falling below a specific threshold.\n",
    "- It employs the **geometric Brownian motion model**, a stochastic process commonly used to represent financial asset prices, to simulate numerous potential trajectories of the CPI.\n",
    "- The code extracts historical CPI data, calculates essential parameters like mean and standard deviation, and generates random Wiener increments to simulate the unpredictable nature of market movements.\n",
    "- It then constructs a DataFrame of simulated CPI paths and visualizes the 80th, 50th, and 20th percentiles of these paths.\n",
    "- Finally, it estimates the probability of inflation falling below 2% in a specific year by analyzing the simulated inflation rates."
